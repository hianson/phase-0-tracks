**Release 1: **

* What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

Using Linux gives a lot of freedom and flexibility to the user. Although many other operating systems try to prevent the user from doing unsafe things, Linux allows users to get into trouble, so to speak.

* In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?  

Features of the server are totally customizable since it is not shared, and therefore resources are all directed to your project so you can rely on the it to stay online. VPS may also allow you to employ better security features.


* Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?  
Root user has complete freedom to do anything. It's possible to very accidentally make a mistake with essential files/directories (maybe delete them). Making a new user ensures better security for your system, and you should be able to do everything you need to without the root user.
