<!--
What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
	-Semantic tags give 'human' meaning to the content which the tags wrap around. For example, if we're reviewing some code, we know the main content of the webpage begins when we see the <main> tag, as opposed to browser information which is stored in the <head> tag. Semantic tags are useful not only for accessibility reasons, but for quickly understanding how the code on a webpage is organized, which can be helpful for developers.

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
	-I suppose since HTML is read from top to bottom, this means that the browser may also display elements in that order too.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
	-Although i'm using the Atom text editor, it has mostly the same features and shortcuts. From learning about snippets, I think a common use for it would be to create a snippet of the index.html of your website so that local links will have some of the same elements (and design), especially such as the title tag and nav, and maybe the header. Creating a snippet for this would help keep your website consistent, and may ultimately improve workflow. 

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
	-I would have liked the GPS to mention a bit about the extent to which HTML5 Semantics are important for accessibility, as well as Search Engine Optimization. Otherwise, the GPS was not difficult!
