# 6.7 Solo Challenge

# User can enter a word (or phrase) and another user attempts to guess that word
# Guesses are limited, max guesses are related to length of word
# Repeated guesses don't count (store previous guesses in array)
# Guesser gets continual feedback on state of word:
	# unicorn : _ _ _ c _ _ _
# Give congrats for winning or taunting message for losing

# our game should ...
# allow user 1 to enter a word
# allow user 2 to enter (guess) a word which matches user 1's word
# see if user 2's guess matches user 1's word
# have a variable which keeps track of user 2's guess count (repeated guesses don't count)
# print the current state of user 2's guesses unicorn : _ _ _ c _ _ _
# print a congrats message for winning, and taunt message for losing
